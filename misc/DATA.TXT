nmap on steroid

sandmap is a tool supporting network and system reconnaissance using the massive Nmap engine. It provides a user-friendly interface, automates and speeds up scanning and allows you to easily use many advanced scanning techniques.
Key Features

    simple CLI with the ability to run pure Nmap engine
    predefined scans included in the modules
    support Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) with scripts arguments
    TOR support (with proxychains)
    multiple scans at one time
    at this point: 31 modules with 459 scan profiles

How To Use

It's simple:

# Clone this repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/trimstray/sandmap

# Go into the repository
cd sandmap

# Install
./setup.sh install

# Run the app
sandmap

        symlink to bin/sandmap is placed in /usr/local/bin
        man page is placed in /usr/local/man/man8

Command Line

Before using the sandmap read the Command Line introduction.
Configuration

The etc/main.cfg configuration file has the following structure:

# shellcheck shell=bash

# Specifies the default destination.
# Examples:
#   - dest="127.0.0.1,8.8.8.8"
dest="127.0.0.1"

# Specifies the extended Nmap parameters.
# Examples:
#   - params="--script ssl-ccs-injection -p 443"
params=""

# Specifies the default output type and path.
# Examples:
#   - report="xml"
report=""

# Specifies the TOR connection.
# Examples:
#   - tor="true"
tor=""

# Specifies the terminal type.
# Examples:
#   - terminal="internal"
terminal="internal"

Requirements

sandmap uses external utilities to be installed before running:

    nmap
    xterm
    proxychains

This tool working with:

    GNU/Linux (testing on Debian and CentOS)
    Bash (testing on 4.4.19)
    Nmap (testing on 7.70)

Also you will need root access.



What is a subdomain takeover?

    Subdomain takeover vulnerabilities occur when a subdomain (subdomain.example.com) is pointing to a service (e.g. GitHub pages, Heroku, etc.) that has been removed or deleted. This allows an attacker to set up a page on the service that was being used and point their page to that subdomain. For example, if subdomain.example.com was pointing to a GitHub page and the user decided to delete their GitHub page, an attacker can now create a GitHub page, add a CNAME file containing subdomain.example.com, and claim subdomain.example.com.

You can read up more about subdomain takeovers here:

https://github.com/chrismaddalena/ODIN/wiki/Graphing-Data
https://github.com/chrismaddalena/ODIN
Observe, Detect, and Investigate Networks

ODIN performs this in multiple phases:
Phase 1 - Asset Discovery

    Collect basic organization information from sources like the Full Contact marketing database.
    Check DNS Dumpster, Netcraft, and TLS certificates to discover subdomains for the provided domains.
    Resolve domain and subdomains to IP addresses via socket connections and DNS records.
    Collect information for all IP addresses, such as ownership and organization data, from RDAP, whois, and other data sources.
    Lookup domains and search for IP addresses on Shodan to collect additional data, such as operating systems, service banners, and open ports.
    Check for the possibility of takeovers and domain fronting with the domains and subdomains.

Phase 2 - Employee Discovery

    Harvest email addresses and employee names for the target organization.
    Link employees to social media profiles via search engines and the Twitter API.
    Cross check discovered email addresses with Troy Hunt's Have I Been Pwned.

Phase 3 - Cloud and Web Services

    Hunt for Office files and PDFs under the target domain, download them, and extract metadata.
    Search for AWS S3 buckets and Digital Ocean Spaces using keywords related to the organization.
    Take screenshots of discovered web services for a quick, early review of services.

Phase 4 - Reporting

    Save all data to a SQLite3 database to allow the data to be easily queried.
    Generate an HTML report using default SQL queries to make it simple to peruse the data in a web browser.
    Create a Neo4j graph database that ties all of the discovered entities (IP addresses, domains, subdomains, ports, and certificates) together with relationships (e.g. RESOLVES_TO, HAS_PORT).

https://github.com/michenriksen/aquatone/releases/tag/v1.7.0
https://github.com/0xInfection/TIDoS-Framework
The Offensive Manual Web Application Penetration Testing Framework.



Here is some light on what the framework is all about:

    A complete versatile framework to cover up everything from Reconnaissance to Vulnerability Analysis.
    Has 5 main phases, subdivided into 14 sub-phases consisting a total of 108 modules.
    Reconnaissance Phase has 50 modules of its own (including active and passive recon, information disclosure modules).
    Scanning & Enumeration Phase has got 16 modules (including port scans, WAF analysis, etc)
    Vulnerability Analysis Phase has 37 modules (including most common vulnerabilites in action).
    Exploits Castle has only 1 exploit. (purely developmental)
    And finally, Auxillaries have got 4 modules. more under development
    All four phases each have a Auto-Awesome module which automates every module for you.
    You just need the domain, and leave everything is to this tool.
    TIDoS has full verbose out support, so you'll know whats going on.
    Fully user friendly interaction environment. (no shits)

OWASP Nettacker project is created to automate information gathering, vulnerability scanning and eventually generating a report for networks, including services, bugs, vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and other information. This software will utilize TCP SYN, ACK, ICMP and many other protocols in order to detect and bypass Firewall/IDS/IPS devices. By leveraging a unique method in OWASP Nettacker for discovering protected services and devices such as SCADA. It would make a competitive edge compared to other scanner making it one of the bests.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trimstray/otseca/master/static/img/otseca_logo.png
The main goal

The main assumption of creating this tool was easier and faster delivery of commands sets to be performed on customer environments. As a result of such a scan I wanted to get the most useful information about system components that will be subjected to penetration tests and audits at a later time.
For whom

Otseca facilitates collection of many important information about a given system.

It is useful for:

    ballot_box_with_check system administrators
    ballot_box_with_check security researchers
    ballot_box_with_check security professionals
    ballot_box_with_check pentesters
    ballot_box_with_check hackers

How To Use

It's simple:

# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/trimstray/otseca

# Go into the repository
cd otseca

# Install
./setup.sh install

# Run the app
otseca --ignore-failed --tasks system,network --output /tmp/report
